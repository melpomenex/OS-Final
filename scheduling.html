            <h2>Core Concepts & Fundamentals</h2>
            
            <h3>Definition & Importance</h3>
            <p><strong>Energy-aware scheduling</strong> refers to OS-level task scheduling strategies that account for power consumption in addition to traditional metrics like performance and fairness. In mobile devices, which run on finite battery capacity, energy-aware scheduling is crucial to prolong battery life. Unlike servers or desktops, smartphones and tablets must aggressively save power when possible, making efficient use of the CPU and other components. The scheduler in a mobile OS decides <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> (which core) to run each task, and an energy-aware scheduler aims to make these decisions in a way that reduces power usage while still meeting performance needs.</p>
            
            <h3>Evolution from Traditional Scheduling</h3>
            <p>Early CPU schedulers (e.g. the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler or classic round-robin schedulers) largely focused on maximizing throughput and responsiveness, assuming power was not a primary concern. As mobile computing took off, researchers began exploring scheduling that treats energy as a first-class resource. For example, researchers in the early 2000s proposed OS modifications to budget and schedule energy usage (such as the ECOSystem project that introduced the concept of a "virtual battery" for tasks).</p>
            
            <p>These early efforts paved the way for today's platforms where power management is deeply integrated into scheduling decisions. Modern mobile OS schedulers incorporate mechanisms like dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) and multi-core task placement policies to balance performance with energy use. Essentially, the field evolved from <em>performance-only scheduling</em> toward <em>performance-per-watt optimization</em>.</p>
            
            <h3>Power Management Challenges in Mobile</h3>
            <p>Mobile devices present unique power management challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They rely on a battery with limited energy, so any inefficient CPU usage directly shortens uptime.</li>
                <li>Workloads on phones are highly variable – a device may be idle or in standby most of the time, then suddenly need bursts of performance.</li>
                <li>Thermal constraints are tighter on mobile; excessive CPU use can cause overheating in a fanless phone.</li>
                <li>Mobile OS schedulers must coordinate with many other components (display, radio, sensors) that have their own power states.</li>
                <li>User experience is paramount – any scheduling that conserves energy but causes noticeable lag or slowness can degrade the user's perception of the device.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Trade-offs: Performance vs. Responsiveness vs. Energy</h3>
            <p>A fundamental issue in energy-aware scheduling is the trade-off between <strong>performance (throughput)</strong>, <strong>responsiveness (low latency)</strong>, and <strong>energy conservation</strong>. High performance often implies running the CPU at a high frequency or on a powerful core, which uses more power. Conversely, saving energy might involve slowing down the CPU or using a lower-power core, which could reduce performance or increase the latency of completing tasks.</p>
            
            <p>One classic strategy is <em>"race to idle"</em>: run the processor at a high speed to finish tasks quickly, then enter an idle low-power state. This can be efficient because idle power draw is very low, but the burst of high-speed operation must be carefully managed. The opposite strategy is to <em>"slow down"</em> the CPU to just meet the needed performance, avoiding wasteful over-provisioning of speed but potentially keeping the CPU active longer.</p>
            
            <p>Mobile schedulers often blend these approaches. For example, ARM's big.LITTLE architecture is essentially an extreme form of dynamic frequency scaling where the scheduler can <em>migrate a thread from a high-power core to a low-power core</em> once the intense part of its work is done.</p>

            <h2>Technical Architecture</h2>
            
            <h3>Key Components in Modern Mobile OS Scheduling</h3>
            <p>Energy-aware scheduling in a mobile OS kernel involves cooperation between the <strong>CPU scheduler</strong>, the <strong>power management subsystem</strong>, and hardware features like DVFS and idle states. The scheduler is responsible for assigning threads/processes to CPU cores and determining their run order. In an energy-aware design, the scheduler is augmented with an <strong>Energy Model</strong> – a representation of the power cost of running on each core at various frequencies.</p>
            
            <p>For example, the Linux kernel's scheduler can use an energy model to estimate how much energy a task would use on a big core vs. a little core at a given load. The power management subsystem provides interfaces to control CPU frequency (voltage/frequency scaling governors) and to activate deeper <strong>sleep states</strong> (idle states C-states) when CPUs are inactive.</p>
            
            <p>Key kernel components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DVFS Governor:</strong> Adjusts CPU frequency based on load or scheduler input (e.g. Linux's <code>schedutil</code> governor directly uses scheduler signals to set frequency).</li>
                <li><strong>Task Scheduler:</strong> Decides on which core(s) tasks run and for how long. An energy-aware scheduler has additional logic to factor energy costs into these decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Model Data:</strong> Typically provided by hardware/OEM – e.g. tables of power consumption for each core at each frequency. The scheduler consults this to make energy-optimal decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Idle State Manager:</strong> Puts cores to sleep when they have no work, and perhaps coordinates <em>core parking</em> (turning off unused cores) to save power.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Task Classification & Workload Characterization</h3>
            <p>To make intelligent scheduling decisions, the OS may classify tasks by their behavior or requirements. Mobile systems often distinguish between <em>interactive</em> tasks (foreground apps, UI threads) and <em>background</em> tasks. For example, Android places background services and jobs into separate cgroups and can give them lower CPU priority or restrict which cores they run on.</p>
            
            <p>By characterizing workload intensity (CPU-bound vs I/O-bound, short burst vs long-running) the scheduler can decide how to schedule the task efficiently. A heavy computation that isn't time-sensitive could be scheduled on a slower, energy-efficient core, whereas an urgent UI task (like processing a touch event) might be placed on a fast core.</p>
            
            <p>Modern schedulers use techniques like <strong>utilization tracking</strong> to gauge how demanding a task is. In fact, Android's scheduler enhancements include a <strong>windowed load tracker</strong> that quickly detects when a task becomes interactive, so it can boost it appropriately.</p>
            
            <h3>CPU Frequency Scaling, Core Parking, and Task Placement</h3>
            <p>These three mechanisms are closely related in an energy-aware system:</p>
            
            <p><em>CPU frequency scaling (DVFS)</em> allows the OS to run a processor core faster or slower depending on current needs, directly affecting power draw (higher frequency & voltage = higher power). The scheduler can either directly set the frequency or collaborate with a DVFS governor.</p>
            
            <p><em>Core parking</em> refers to idling entire cores when load is low – effectively consolidating work onto fewer cores so that other cores can enter deep sleep states (which draw near-zero power). An energy-aware scheduler will attempt to "pack" light tasks onto one core or one cluster, allowing another core to shut off.</p>
            
            <p><em>Task placement</em> is the decision of which specific core will run a given thread. In a heterogeneous multi-core system (like ARM big.LITTLE), this is a critical decision for energy: the same task might use, say, 200 mW on a LITTLE core but 500 mW on a big core (while finishing sooner). The scheduler needs to decide not just <em>when</em> to run a task, but <em>on which core</em> to run it for optimal energy usage.</p>

            </div>
            
            <h3>Integration with Power States & Sleep Modes</h3>
            <p>Mobile OS scheduling is tightly integrated with CPU power states (idle states) and system sleep modes. When the scheduler finds no task to run on a core, it will invoke the <strong>idle loop</strong>, which can put the core into a low-power idle state (like ARM's WFI – wait-for-interrupt).</p>
            
            <p>Advanced mobile CPUs have multiple idle depths, from a light sleep that saves moderate power with quick wake-up, down to deep sleep that saves maximum power but takes longer to resume. The scheduler's decisions (like consolidating tasks on one core) determine whether other cores can enter these deep states.</p>
            
            <p>Furthermore, modern mobile OSs implement system-wide sleep modes such as Android's Doze mode. In Doze mode, the system <em>aggressively schedules and batches tasks</em> to allow long intervals of deep sleep. For example, when a device is stationary with the screen off, Android defers background CPU and network activity – effectively the scheduler will not run background jobs except during periodic maintenance windows.</p>

        <section id="implementation" class="section">
            <h2>Implementation Across Mobile Platforms</h2>
            <p>Modern mobile operating systems like <strong>Android</strong> (with a Linux kernel) and <strong>iOS</strong> (with the XNU kernel) both implement energy-aware scheduling, though the details and openness of their implementations differ.</p>
            
            <h3 id="android">Android (Linux Kernel Scheduling)</h3>
            <p>Android relies on the Linux kernel's scheduler, which has evolved significant energy-aware features in recent years. A major addition has been the <strong>Energy-Aware Scheduling (EAS)</strong> framework, introduced around Linux 4.14 and merged in Linux 5.0 (2019) with contributions from ARM and Linaro engineers.</p>
            
            <p>EAS extends Linux's scheduler (the Completely Fair Scheduler, CFS) with the ability to consider an energy cost function when deciding on task placement. In an EAS-enabled system, the kernel is provided with an <em>energy model</em> of the CPU clusters (often via Device Tree on Android devices).</p>
            
            <p>This model includes information like: for each cluster (big or little) and each frequency, what is the relative capacity (performance) and power consumption. The scheduler then computes the projected energy impact of scheduling a task on various cores.</p>
            
            <p>In simplified terms, Android's EAS will try to place tasks on a CPU (or set of CPUs) that results in the lowest increase in total energy consumption, <em>subject to meeting the task's performance needs</em>. If the big core would finish it much faster but at higher power, EAS might still choose the LITTLE core if the task isn't urgent. On the other hand, if the user is waiting (e.g., an UI thread), EAS will use a big core despite the energy cost, for the sake of performance.</p>
            
            <p>In addition to EAS, Android uses several other mechanisms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>SchedTune / Uclamp</strong> (utilization clamping) is an interface that allows the system to boost or cap the apparent CPU utilization of groups of tasks. The Android framework uses this to temporarily boost interactive tasks.</li>
                <li>Android's scheduler also interacts with the <strong>cpuidle</strong> mechanism to power down cores.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Constraints:</strong> Android also has to deal with real-time (RT) and latency-sensitive workloads – e.g. audio playback, video recording, telephony, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="ios">iOS (XNU Kernel Scheduling)</h3>
            <p>Apple's iOS (and iPadOS) uses the XNU kernel, which has its own scheduler and power management design. While Apple doesn't publish as much detail, we do know that since the Apple A11 Bionic (2017), iPhones have heterogeneous CPU cores (Apple's marketing calls them <em>performance cores</em> and <em>efficiency cores</em> rather than big/LITTLE).</p>
            
            <p>In the A11 and later (including M1/M2 in Macs, which share a similar architecture), the scheduler can utilize all cores simultaneously – Apple bragged that iOS could run high-performance tasks on the big cores while low-power tasks ran on the efficiency cores, improving both performance and battery life.</p>
            
            <p>Apple's approach relies heavily on <strong>Quality of Service (QoS) classes</strong> and the concept of <em>task urgency</em> to inform scheduling. Developers on iOS/macOS assign QoS to their threads or operations – for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>user-interactive</strong> (highest priority for things like UI updates)</li>
                <li><strong>user-initiated</strong> (high priority for tasks the user is actively waiting on)</li>
                <li><strong>utility</strong> (medium priority for long-running tasks like downloads)</li>
                <li><strong>background</strong> (lowest priority for maintenance tasks)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The scheduler uses these hints to make decisions about CPU allocation. In practice, a background QoS task will tend to run on an efficiency core when the system is busy, so that it doesn't steal cycles (and battery) from more important tasks. Conversely, a user-interactive task (like handling a touch or rendering a frame) will get preference for the high-performance cores.</p>
            
            <p>iOS also aggressively manages CPU frequency and idle states behind the scenes. Apple's SoCs have a custom power management controller (PMIC) and firmware that likely works with the scheduler. When the system is largely idle or doing lightweight tasks, iOS can run mostly on the efficiency cores and even power down the performance cores entirely.</p>
            
            <h3 id="other-platforms">Other Mobile Platforms and Variations</h3>
            <p>Beyond Android and iOS, other mobile or embedded OSes also incorporate energy-aware scheduling principles:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linux-based Mobile OSes:</strong> Any system using the Linux kernel (e.g. Ubuntu Touch, or Samsung's Tizen in the past) can benefit from the same EAS and DVFS mechanisms as Android.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Huawei HarmonyOS:</strong> Huawei's newer OS for phones is based on a microkernel plus LiteOS combo. Details are scarce, but given it runs on similar hardware, it likely implements similar scheduling strategies.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Google Fuchsia:</strong> Fuchsia OS uses a microkernel (Zircon). Instead of a monolithic Linux scheduler, Zircon has its own scheduling approach.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Custom OEM Schedulers:</strong> Some device makers experimented with their own schedulers or kernel mods before EAS was mature. For instance, MediaTek had an energy-aware scheduler for its chipsets; Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips often used a "power aware scheduler" tweak.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Measurement & Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Tools for Energy Measurement</h3>
            <p>A range of tools exist to measure energy consumption in mobile devices:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Hardware Power Monitors:</em> Devices like the Monsoon Power Monitor can physically measure the voltage and current going into a smartphone, providing precise energy usage data.</li>
                <li><em>On-Device Sensors:</em> Modern phones have fuel gauge circuits that estimate battery consumption. Android exposes some of this via the BatteryStats API.</li>
                <li><em>Software Profilers:</em> Qualcomm's Trepn Profiler (an Android app) can display per-component power estimates (CPU, network, etc.) by using built-in counters.</li>
                <li><em>OS Tracing Tools:</em> Tools like <code>perf</code> and ftrace on Linux can trace scheduler decisions, CPU frequencies, and idle times.</li>
                <li><em>Platform-specific tools:</em> Apple's Xcode Instruments includes an <em>Energy Log</em> instrument that developers use to see how their app affects system energy.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Metrics for Evaluation</h3>
            <p>When analyzing energy-aware scheduling, some common metrics include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Energy Consumption (Joules or mAh):</strong> Total energy used over a test period or for a particular task.</li>
                <li><strong>Battery Life (hours):</strong> In user-facing terms, does the scheduling improvement translate to longer battery life?</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> These include task latency (how quickly a task completes), throughput, frame render time for UI, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Utilization and Idle Time:</strong> How effectively does the scheduler keep the CPU in low-power idle states?</li>
                <li><strong>Thermal Throttling Incidence:</strong> Though more indirect, a good scheduler might also reduce how often the device overheats and throttles.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Power Modeling in Scheduling Decisions</h3>
            <p>Because measuring power in real-time is hard, many schedulers rely on <em>models</em> or estimates. The Linux EAS, for instance, uses a model of CPU power: essentially a table of "power cost per unit of utilization" for each CPU. Using this, the scheduler can <em>predict</em> how much extra power the system will use if it schedules a task on CPU X vs CPU Y.</p>
            
            <p>These models are usually provided by the SoC vendor (based on characterization of the silicon). In research, there are also algorithmic models: for example, a formula that assumes dynamic power is proportional to f³ (frequency cubed) due to the voltage-frequency relationship.</p>

            <h2>State-of-the-Art Research</h2>
            <p>Energy-aware scheduling remains an active area of research (2020–present) as new hardware emerges and new techniques (like machine learning) become practical. Here we overview some significant recent research directions and findings:</p>
            
            <h3>Machine Learning for Scheduling</h3>
            <p>A notable trend is applying machine learning to scheduling and DVFS control. Instead of hand-tuned heuristics, researchers have experimented with techniques like <em>reinforcement learning (RL)</em> to train a scheduler that dynamically finds the optimal balance for a given device and workload.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a 2021 study used deep RL to adjust CPU frequencies and core allocations in real-time, based on feedback of performance counters and power usage. The RL agent learned policies that saved energy compared to the default Linux governor, without hurting responsiveness.</p>
            
            <h3>Heterogeneous Scheduling Algorithms</h3>
            <p>With the proliferation of heterogeneous processors (not just CPU big.LITTLE, but also CPU/GPU/NPU heterogeneity), recent works focus on algorithms that optimally schedule <em>across different processor types</em>.</p>
            
            <p>One example is scheduling computation between CPU and specialized AI accelerators: an energy-aware scheduler might decide at runtime to run a machine learning inference on a DSP or NPU (neural processing unit) instead of the CPU, if it's more energy efficient.</p>
            
            <h3>Thermal-aware Scheduling</h3>
            <p>There is growing awareness that energy and thermal management must work hand in hand. A number of recent works consider <em>thermal-aware scheduling</em>, which essentially is energy-aware scheduling with an eye on temperature.</p>
            
            <p>High temperature can both damage components and also cause energy inefficiency (heat is wasted energy). By scheduling tasks in ways that avoid heat buildup, these approaches maintain performance while avoiding costly thermal throttling events.</p>
            
            <h3>Unsolved Challenges</h3>
            <p>Despite progress, several challenges remain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Workload Diversity:</em> Mobile devices run everything from games to web browsing to background AI tasks. No single scheduling policy is optimal for all.</li>
                <li><em>Energy Modeling Complexity:</em> As hardware gets more complex, modeling the energy impact of a scheduling decision is non-trivial.</li>
                <li><em>Coordination with Userspace:</em> The OS doesn't always know the intent of a task – e.g., a computation could be preloading content that the user might never actually view.</li>
                <li><em>Verification and Stability:</em> Introducing complex energy-aware logic (especially ML-based) raises the question: how to ensure the scheduler is stable and bug-free?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Implementation Examples</h2>
            
            <h3>Pseudocode Example: Simplified Energy-Aware Scheduler</h3>
            <p>Below is a pseudocode representation of how an energy-aware scheduler might choose a CPU for a new task, considering a big.LITTLE system:</p>
            
            <pre><code># Data structures (assumed to be provided by platform)
cores = [ core1, core2, ..., coreN ]
energy_model[core][freq] -&gt; power (mW)  # power of core at a given frequency
capacity[core] -&gt; relative performance capacity of core (e.g., 1024 for big, 512 for little)

function schedule_task(task):
    best_core = None
    best_energy = infinity
    required_capacity = task.utilization_estimate  # e.g., how much CPU the task will use
    
    for core in cores:
        # Determine min frequency needed on this core to handle the task
        freq = find_lowest_frequency(core) such that (capacity(core) * freq &gt;= required_capacity)
        # If even max freq can't handle task (rare for normal tasks), skip core
        if freq is None:
            continue
        # Estimate energy if task runs on this core at that frequency
        power = energy_model[core][freq]
        time = task.workload_cycles / (freq * core.instructions_per_cycle)
        energy = power * time
        # Also consider idle energy of other cores if needed (omitted for simplicity)
        if energy &lt; best_energy:
            best_energy = energy
            best_core = core
    
    if best_core is not None:
        assign task to best_core at the determined frequency
    else:
        assign task to a default core  # e.g., highest capacity core if nothing else</code></pre>
            
            <h3>Kernel-Level vs Application-Level Implementation</h3>
            <p>It's important to note which aspects of energy-aware scheduling are in the kernel and which are controlled by applications:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><em>Kernel-level:</em> Task scheduling, CPU frequency control, and idle state decisions are all kernel responsibilities. They operate at a low level with a global view of the system.</li>
                <li><em>Application-level:</em> App and framework developers also play a role in energy-aware scheduling by using the OS-provided APIs correctly.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>APIs and Interfaces for Developers</h3>
            <p>Mobile OSes expose various interfaces that developers (or system integrators) can use to participate in energy-aware scheduling:</p>
            
            <h4>Android APIs:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>JobScheduler</code> (Android API) – to schedule jobs that the system will run in a batch when appropriate.</li>
                <li><code>AlarmManager</code> – for scheduling timed operations.</li>
                <li><code>PowerManager</code> – apps can check if the device is in low-power mode.</li>
                <li><code>Thermal APIs</code> – newer Android releases let apps get notifications of thermal status.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>iOS APIs:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><code>DispatchQueue</code> QoS classes – When using Grand Central Dispatch or NSOperation, developers specify QoS for the work item.</li>
                <li><code>Background Fetch</code> / <code>Background Tasks</code> – iOS provides mechanisms for apps to do periodic background updates.</li>
                <li><code>Low Power Mode</code> awareness – Apps can detect if Low Power Mode is on.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="applications" class="section">
            <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
            <p>Energy-aware scheduling has concrete implications for app developers and end-users. Here are some practical applications and best practices in modern mobile apps and systems:</p>
            
            <h3>App Optimization for Battery Life</h3>
            <p>Application developers are increasingly conscious of not wasting CPU cycles (and thus battery). A well-behaved modern mobile app will avoid busy-waiting or doing heavy work in the background when not necessary.</p>
            
            <p>For example, if an app needs to refresh content, instead of polling every minute (which wakes the CPU frequently), it might use push notifications or job scheduling to let the OS decide when to wake it. Many apps provide a "battery saver" or "low power mode" within the app that reduces visual effects or background sync rate.</p>
            
            <h3>Background Processing Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Both Android and iOS provide frameworks to handle background work in an energy-efficient manner:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Android's <code>WorkManager</code> will automatically defer tasks to comply with Doze and App Standby modes.</li>
                <li>iOS's <code>BGProcessingTaskRequest</code> allows the system to batch tasks for optimal energy usage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Foreground vs Background Behavior</h3>
            <p>Mobile OS scheduling strongly differentiates based on app state. When an app is in the foreground (visible to the user), it is generally allowed to use more CPU and the scheduler will favor giving it resources. When the app goes to background, the OS often reduces its scheduling priority or freezes it.</p>
            
            <h3>Handling Low Power Mode and Battery Saver</h3>
            <p>Both iOS and Android have system-wide battery saver modes. When engaged, these modes dynamically alter scheduling policies. For instance, Android's Battery Saver will make the scheduler more aggressive about keeping cores idle and will down-clock the CPU. iOS's Low Power Mode similarly pauses background app refresh and reduces CPU performance.</p>
            
            <h3>Developer Best Practices</h3>
            <p>To align with the OS scheduling for energy, developers follow best practices such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using throttling for frequent updates (e.g. location)</li>
                <li>Avoiding polling and using event-driven designs</li>
                <li>Offloading work to appropriate times (e.g. when charging)</li>
                <li>Respecting Doze and App Standby</li>
                <li>Monitoring app battery usage and optimizing hotspots</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Directions</h2>
            <p>Looking ahead, the next 5+ years will likely bring new developments in energy-aware scheduling as both hardware and software continue to evolve. Here are some anticipated directions:</p>
            
            <h3>New Hardware Architectures</h3>
            <p>As new CPU architectures like ARMv9 emerge and <strong>RISC-V</strong> enters the scene for mobile devices, schedulers will need to adapt. ARMv9 continues the big.LITTLE concept (e.g., Cortex-X series as very big cores, Cortex-A7xx as big, and A5xx as little cores in a tri-tier setup).</p>
            
            <p>Schedulers may evolve to handle <em>three-tier heterogeneity</em> – some recent Android SoCs already have Prime core, Big cores, and LITTLE cores. The algorithmic complexity increases, and we might see more sophisticated decision-making or grouping.</p>
            
            <h3>AI/ML Integration</h3>
            <p>We expect a deeper role of AI in scheduling. Instead of static heuristics or even the current per-device tuning, future schedulers might continuously learn from usage patterns.</p>
            
            <p>Imagine a scheduler that, after observing your daily routine, learns to predict the "rush hour" of tasks (email sync in morning, heavy use during lunch, idle in afternoon, gaming in evening) and proactively optimizes for those phases.</p>
            
            <h3>Cross-component Scheduling</h3>
            <p>Future improvements will likely see better coordination between CPU scheduling and other components like the GPU, modem, and display. Currently, these are often managed semi-independently.</p>
            
            <p>A holistic approach could consider the whole system power. For instance, if the GPU is busy (say a game is running), the scheduler might decide to favor efficiency cores for CPU tasks since the GPU is the bottleneck anyway, saving some CPU power.</p>
            
            <h3>Increased User Control and Transparency</h3>
            <p>As power management becomes more sophisticated, we might also see more user-facing controls or at least transparency. For example, Android could expose more options in developer settings to bias the scheduler toward power saving or performance.</p>
            
            <p>Gamers might get toggles to go into an ultra-performance mode, whereas others might choose an ultra battery saver that goes beyond today's modes. The challenge is presenting it simply – average users won't want to micromanage cores.</p>
            
            <h3>Ultra-Low-Power OS Scheduling</h3>
            <p>With the rise of IoT and ultra-mobile devices (wearables, AR glasses), OS schedulers might be adapted to even tighter energy envelopes. Techniques like <em>event-driven scheduling</em> (where the CPU stays in deep sleep and only wakes on events, processing them quickly then sleeping) will be critical.</p>
